How to submit scripts:

To submit your script, please create a new issue with .ds source file attached to it. (use \``` at the start and end of the script \``` to select it)
Then explain what the script affects and with what mods (provide download links to mods) it integrates.
After that, we are going to test your script, it's validity and reply with a code line that you'll add for future updates.
To update your script, create another issue with the new script attached to it AND with original script issue tagged (so we can verify that is is actually you doing the update)
Your script is going to get compiled with latest compilers and distributed in the browser upon approval. Afterwards the issue is going to be closed.

In case if the script is going to be rejected, we are going to explain the reason first, add add "changes required" tag and close the issue.
When you fix whatever happens, upload a new .ds file and reopen the issue.
